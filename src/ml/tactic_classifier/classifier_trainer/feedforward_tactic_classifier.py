    Pretrained neural network classifier adapted for CSGO tactic prediction.
    
    Architecture:
    - Input layer: Accepts normalized feature vectors
    - Hidden layers: Multiple fully-connected layers with ReLU activations
    - Dropout: Regularization to prevent overfitting
    - Output layer: Softmax over tactic classes
    
    This is implemented as a feature-based classifier that takes learned
    representations rather than raw images, making it ideal for our graph data.
