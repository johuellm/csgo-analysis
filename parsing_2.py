    To analyze the game play data better we need some additional data from the CS demos. Here are the changes that (hopefully) can be implemented:
    - Keystrokes: do you think it's possible to get the information on which buttons they press/hold at what time?
    - the current time interval is 1 sec. if I'm not mistaken. Can we get three different time intervals in addition? We want to check if that changes the level of abstraction and maybe makes it easier to see patterns/analyse the data. Preferably 5, 10, and 15 sec. intervals.
    - the status on game economics: Which player has how much money.
    - available utilities: how many/which utilities are left this round for each players?
    - Split the data for per round. Maybe one Excel file per round?
    - the movement speed of each player each interval. What's the maximum movement speed (running with a knife vs. crouching with a weapon)?
    Do you think it's possible to implement those things? If so, when do you got time to work on it?
    - performance scores per round (win-lose, damage dealt)
